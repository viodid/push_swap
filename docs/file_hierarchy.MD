**Source Code Directory (`src/`):**
- The `src/` directory typically contains all the source code files for your project. This includes C source files (`.c`) and possibly header files (`.h`) if they are not stored separately.
- Organize your source files by functionality or module. For example, you might have separate subdirectories for different components of your application.

**Header Files Directory (`include/` or `inc/`):**
- Header files (`.h`) that declare function prototypes, data structures, and constants are often placed in an `include/` or `inc/` directory. This separation allows for cleaner code and better code organization.
- Header files should be organized in a way that makes it easy for other parts of your codebase to include and use them.

**Object Files or Build Directory (`obj/` or `build/`):**
- When your code is compiled, object files (`.o`) and other build artifacts are typically placed in a separate directory (e.g., `obj/` or `build/`). This keeps your source directory clean and separates source code from compiled output.
- The structure within the build directory may mimic the source directory's structure.

**Executable Output Directory (`bin/` or `output/`):**
- Compiled executables or final output files (e.g., `.exe`, `.out`) are often placed in a `bin/` or `output/` directory.
- In some projects, you may have different subdirectories within `bin/` for different types of output (e.g., `bin/debug/` and `bin/release/`).

**Library Files Directory (`lib/`):**
- If your project produces libraries (e.g., static or dynamic libraries), they are commonly placed in a `lib/` directory.
- Similar to the executable output directory, you might have subdirectories within `lib/` for different library versions or types.

**Configuration Files (`config/` or `etc/`):**
- Configuration files, if any, may be placed in a `config/` or `etc/` directory. These files can include settings, data files, or any other configuration-related content.

**Documentation (`docs/`):**
- Documentation for your project, including README files, API documentation, or user manuals, can be placed in a `docs/` directory.

**Build Scripts (`scripts/` or `build/`):**
- Scripts used for building, testing, or automating various tasks can be placed in a `scripts/` or `build/` directory.

**Test Code (`tests/`):**
- If your project includes unit tests, integration tests, or test suites, you can place them in a `tests/` directory.
